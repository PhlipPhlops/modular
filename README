### Getting Started
After cloning the repo, you'll need to set up the frontend and backend individually.

## Frontend
In the frontend_react folder, run `npm install` to collect all packages.

# Start the frontend development server
In `frontend_react/`, run `npm start` to fire up webpack and start the development server

## Backend
You'll need to `pip install -r requirements.txt` to sync up the python dependencies.
After installing new packages, run `pip pipreqs` to update requirements.txt

# Start backend development server
In `backend_django/` run `python manage.py runserver` to fire up the django server

# Creating a new app
Referencing this tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/
Within the backend_react "project", we'll have distinct "apps".
    For each module, we ought to have a seperate app.
    To generate skeleton code for an app, run 'python manage.py startapp <appname>'
The linked tutorial includes instructions on:
    - Taking in a request and returning a response
    - Setting up a URL to map said request
